# Unsafe Regex Pattern Detector

This project is a Python tool designed to detect potential vulnerabilities in C/C++ source code where user-controlled input is directly used in regular expression constructors without proper sanitization. These unsafe patterns can lead to security risks, such as denial-of-service attacks or logic errors.

## Features
- Scans C/C++ source files for unsafe regex usage.
- Detects patterns involving constructors like `regex()`, `std::regex()`, and `boost::regex()`.
- Flags instances where user-controlled inputs (e.g., `user_input`) are used unsafely.

## Requirements
- Python 3.6 or higher.

## Installation
1. Clone this repository or download the `detect_unsafe_regex.py` file.
2. Ensure Python is installed on your system.
3. Place the C/C++ source file you want to analyze in the same directory as the script or provide its full path.

## Usage
1. Open a terminal and navigate to the project directory.
2. Run the following command:

   ```bash
   python detect_unsafe_regex.py
